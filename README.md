# NN_Forwardpass
The Forward Pass is the fundamental operation in a neural network where input data propagates through layers of neurons to produce an output. This involves matrix multiplications and activation functions applied sequentially across layers.
 Mathematical Formulation:
For a single-layer perceptron:  z=wx+b  ; a=σ(z)
where:
W are the weights,
X is the input,
b is the bias,
σ is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
